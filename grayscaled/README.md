Folder to send images of Grayscale operations

Grayscaling is the process of converting an image from other color spaces e.g. RGB, CMYK, HSV, etc. to shades of gray. It varies between complete black and complete white.

Importance of grayscaling: Dimension reduction, Model complexity reduction and other algorithms compatibility because many algorithms are customized to work only on grayscale images .
